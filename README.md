# Copy-Move Counterfeit Detection: Duplication Method
## Copy-Move falsify detection using the Duplication Method in grayscale by aplying the Principal Component Analysis in python3

This project was an adaptation of the work by *Rahmat Nazali* (github:rahmatnazali), *"Copy-Move Detection on Digital Image using Python"*, with the objective of carrying out detections of the Copy-Move digital image forging method using only a gray scale of the images via the Duplication Method, using a principal component through Principal Component Analysis in python3; using the results to compare and study about both codes. His work can be found at his github [rahmatnazali/image-copy-move-detection](https://github.com/rahmatnazali/image-copy-move-detection).
    
The databases used were taken from the github above and at the following link.[CIVIP Group - Copy-Move Forgery Dataset](http://www.diid.unipa.it/cvip/?page_id=48#CMFD)
